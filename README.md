The HR Data Analysis Dashboard, developed using Power BI, is a comprehensive solution designed to assist HR managers and business leaders in effectively analyzing and managing employee data. Its primary objective is to empower HR professionals to make well-informed decisions regarding employee retention, professional development, and recruitment strategies

Detailed Visualizations: It features interactive charts that display employee distribution and attrition rates segmented by gender, age groups, job satisfaction levels, and educational backgrounds. These visualizations are equipped with legends and filters, allowing users to explore data in greater depth and gain actionable insights

## Key Performance Indicators(KPIs):
<li>Employee Count: The total number of employees in the organization.</li>
<li>Attrition Count: The number of employees who have left the organization.</li>
<li>Attrition Rate: The percentage of employees who have left, indicating the attrition rate.</li>
<li>Active Employees: The count of currently employed staff members.</li>
<li>Average Age: The average age of employees in the organization.</li>

## Visualisation:
1. Attrition by Gender (Lollipop Chart): A lollipop chart visually represents attrition rates based on gender. It provides a clear comparison between male and female employee turnover, aiding in gender-specific attrition analysis.

2. Department-wise Attrition (Pie Chart): A pie chart illustrates attrition distribution across different departments. Each slice represents a department's proportion in the total attrition count, enabling HR managers to identify departments with higher turnover rates.

3. Number of Employees by Age Group (Bar Graph): A bar graph categorizes employees into different age groups, offering insights into the age demographics of the workforce. This visualization helps in understanding the age diversity within the organization.

4. Job Satisfaction Rating (Square Chart): A square chart displays job satisfaction ratings of employees. Each square represents an employee's satisfaction level, providing a visual overview of job satisfaction across the organization.

5. Education Field-wise Attrition (Vertical Bar Graph): A vertical bar graph compares attrition rates across various education fields. This visualization helps in identifying patterns related to specific educational backgrounds, aiding in targeted retention strategies.

6. Education Field-wise Attrition (Donut Plot): A donut plot offers an alternative representation of attrition rates based on education fields. It provides a more detailed view by displaying both the overall attrition rate and the individual contribution of each education field to the attrition count.
